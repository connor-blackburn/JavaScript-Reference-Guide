// A variable is a named container for some kind of data.
// We give variable names which are relevant to the data they hold.
// Good convention suggests always using a letter at the beginning of a variable name and to use camelCase.
// Variables are great as they allow code to be reused, supporting the DRY theory (Don't Repeat Yourself!).

// The syntax (how to create a variable)
var X = 'y';

// 'var' is the variable decleration, this is how you tell JacaScript you want to make a variable
// 'X' here is the name given to the variable. In real life X would be replaced by something more relevant.
// '=' is the assignment operator, this sets the value of the variable.
// 'y' is the actual value. Variables can store a wide range of data types. (Mentioned laater in document).
// ';' is used to complete the variable.


// Examples of variables
var firstName = 'Connor';
var lastName = 'Blackburn';
var age = 21;
var male = true; 

// Results
// 'console.log();' is used to log the value of the varible to the console.
console.log(firstName); // Result = Connor
console.log(lastName); // Result = Blackburn
console.log(age); // Result = 21
console.log(male); // Result = true
